On thursday i started laying down the wires on the breadboard,
 getting a large part of it done. On friday Fiona cut the hard wires and we
 started putting them on as well as the resistors, and almost finished
 placing everything down. Today were doing the last of the hard wires and
 testing out the basic code. Tommorrow we will, if everything goes well today,
 start writing the rest of the code, testing it along the way.
 We'll probaly work on this till the end of friday.
 So this week in summary we will be focusing on the code so
 that we are done by the deadline.
